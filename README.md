# Android-Dictionary-App
Actually I had made a dictionary in my "Data Structures & Algorithms" course in Java using Hash Maps (complexity: O(1)). So, when I was learning
Android I decided to make a dicitonary in Android too using the same java code logic.
I have made this app in android studio. It contains almost 32000+ words of english and their meanings. Initially 
it takes 8 seconds appoximately in loading then after loading it searches the word instantly having Time Complexity O(1).
I am determined to work on it more to reduce the loading time.
